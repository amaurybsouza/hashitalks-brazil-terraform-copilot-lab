# HashiTalks Brazil — Terraform Copilot Lab 🤖🌱

This repository contains a **hands-on lab** created for **HashiTalks Brazil**, demonstrating how **AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot Chat)** can assist engineers in writing **Terraform code faster, safer, and with better practices**.

The lab focuses on combining **Terraform**, **AI-assisted development**, and **DevSecOps principles** to build secure cloud infrastructure without slowing down developers.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to show how **AI can act as a copilot** for:

- Writing Terraform resources and modules  
- Applying cloud and security best practices  
- Improving productivity without sacrificing quality  
- Supporting DevSecOps and SRE workflows  

This lab is designed to be **practical, opinionated, and easy to follow**.

---

## 🧩 What You Will Learn

- How to use **AI prompts** to generate Terraform code  
- How to review and improve AI-generated Terraform  
- Common pitfalls when using AI with Infrastructure as Code  
- How to combine Terraform + AI with **security and reliability in mind**  
- How AI can help explain, refactor, and document Terraform code  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Terraform**
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** (or equivalent AI tools)
- **AWS** (examples can be adapted to other providers)
- **IaC Security & DevSecOps concepts**
- **Policy and best-practice driven infrastructure**
